# Lab: Implement task processing logic by using Azure Functions | Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Your company has built a desktop software tool that parses a local JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file for its configuration settings. During its latest meeting, your team decided to reduce the number of files that are distributed with your application by serving your default configuration settings from a URL instead of from a local file. As the new developer on the team, you've been tasked with evaluating Microsoft Azure Functions as a solution to this problem.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you'll be able to:

- Create an Azure Functions app in the Azure Portal.
- Create a local Azure Functions project using the [Azure Functions Core Tools][azure-functions-core-tools].
- Create various functions by using built-in triggers and input integrations.
- Deploy a local Azure Functions project to Azure.

## Lab setup

- Estimated time: **45 minutes**

## Instructions

### Before you start

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine
- Microsoft Edge
- Windows PowerShell
- Visual Studio Code

### Make an F:\ drive:

There are two ways to create an F:\ with the content 
1. using VHD (virtual hard disk)
2. using subst (map drive to a directory)

#### Make an F:\ drive using VHD
In order to create a VHD on Windows 10, do the following:
1. Open Start.
1. Search for Disk Management and click the top result to launch the experience.
1. Click the Action button.
1. Click the Create VHD option.
1. Click the Browse button and locate the folder you want to store the virtual disk.
1. In the "File name" field enter a name for the drive.
1. Use the "Save as type file" drop-down menu and select Virtual Disk files (.vhdx) . Or select Virtual Disk files (.vhd) if you're planning to create a VHD file.
1. Click the Save button.
1. Under "Virtual hard disk size," specify the size of the drive in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB).
1. Under "Virtual hard disk format," select the VHDX option. (While using a VHDX format is recommended, you can also select the VHD format, but use it only if required.)
1. Under "Virtual hard disk type," select the Dynamic expanding option. (If you have selected the VHD format in the previous step, it's recommended to select the Fixed size option when selecting a type.)
1. Click OK.

Once you complete these steps, you'll have created a VHD that you can then set up and use with any compatible version of Windows.

##### How to set up a VHDX or VHD on Windows 10

1. Using the above steps, you created a VHD, but it's empty without any data or file system. To make it useful, you need to initialize the disk, create a partition, and format the drive using these steps:
1. Right-click the newly created drive button on the far-left side, and click the Initialize Disk option.
1. Select the disk from the list.
1. Check the MBR (Master Boot Record) option. (You could also select the "GPT (GUID Partition Table)" option, but this option isn't supported by all versions of Windows.)
1. Click OK.
1. Right-click the Unallocated space, and select the New Simple Volume option.
1. Click Next.
1. Specify the size of the partition. (Leave this option unchanged if you're planning to use all the available space for the partition.)
1. Click Next.
1. Using the drop-down menu, select the drive letter you want to assign to the drive.
1. Click Next.
1. Under the Format this volume with the following settings section, make sure to use the following options: 
    * File System - NTFS. 
    * Allocation unit size - Default. 
    * Volume label - Use the name of the drive file, but you can enter any name. 
    * Perform a quick format - Formats the drive faster. 
    * Enable file and folder compression - If it's not required, don't select it (optional).
1. Click Next.
1. Click Finish.

After completing these steps, the VHDX or VHD will be initialized, partitioned, and formatted.
The VHD will mount automatically, and you can now access and save files using File Explorer.


##### Make sure to get the labs source and instructions from
https://github.com/betabitnl/AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure

1. Click Code
1. Click download zip
1. Open zip 
1. Extra All file to F:\

#### Make an F:\ drive using subst
By making an F:\ drive using subst it is easier to keep the labs up-to-date with the Github Repo. 

##### Clone the github repo:
In a command prompt goto the direcory where you what to clone the the Github repo into. And type the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/betabitnl/AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure`

##### Create the F:\ drive 
For this example the Github is cloned in `c:\repos\`. To create the F:\ drive with correct content in it, type:

`subst f: c:\repos\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure`

1. Add **using directives** for the **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc**, **Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs**, **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http**, and **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging** namespaces for libraries that will be referenced by the application:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    ```

1. Create a new **public static** class named **Echo**:

    ```csharp
    public static class Echo
    { }
    ```

1. Within the **Echo** class, create a new **public static** method named **Run** that returns a variable of type **IActionResult** and that also takes in variables of type **HttpRequest** and **ILogger** as parameters named *request* and *logger*:

    ```csharp
    public static IActionResult Run(
        HttpRequest request,
        ILogger logger)
    { }
    ```

1. Append an attribute to the **Run** method of type **FunctionNameAttribute** that has its **name** parameter set to a value of **Echo**:

    ```powershell
    httprepl http://localhost:7071
    ```

    > **Note**: An error message is displayed by the httprepl tool. This message occurs because the tool is searching for a Swagger definition file to use to "traverse" the API. Because your functio projectp does not produce a Swagger definition file, you'll need to traverse the API manually.
1. When you receive the tool prompt, browse to the relative **api/echo** directory:

    ```powershell
    cd api
    cd echo
    ```

1. Run the **post** command sending in an HTTP request body set to a numeric value of **3** by using the **\-\-content** option:

    ```powershell
    post --content 3
    ```

1. Run the **post** command sending in an HTTP request body set to a numeric value of **5** by using the **\-\-content** option:

    ```powershell
    post --content 5
    ```

1. Run the **post** command sending in an HTTP request body set to a string value of **"Hello"** by using the **\-\-content** option:

    ```powershell
    post --content "Hello"
    ```

1. Run the **post** command sending in an HTTP request body set to a JSON value of **{"msg": "Successful"}** by using the **\-\-content** option:

    ```powershell
    post --content "{"msg": "Successful"}"
    ```

1. Exit the **httprepl** application:

    ```powershell
    exit
    ```

1. Close all currently running instances of the **Windows Terminal** application.

    ```

1. Create a new **public static** class named **GetSettingInfo**:

    ```csharp
    public static class GetSettingInfo
    { }
    ```

1. Within the **GetSettingInfo** class, create a new **public static** expression-bodied method named **Run** that returns a variable of type **IActionResult** and that also takes in variables of type **HttpRequest** and **string** as parameters named *request* and *json*:

    ```csharp
    public static IActionResult Run(
        HttpRequest request,
        string json)
        => null;
    ```

    > **Note**: You are only temporarily setting the return value to **null**.

1. Append an attribute to the **Run** method of type **FunctionNameAttribute** that has its **name** parameter set to a value of **GetSettingInfo**:

    ```csharp
    [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]

        => null;
    ```

1. Update the **Run** expression-bodied method to return a new instance of the **OkObjectResult** class passing in the value of the **json** method parameter as the sole constructor parameter:

    ```csharp
    [FunctionName("GetSettingInfo")]
    public static IActionResult Run(
        [HttpTrigger("GET")] HttpRequest request,
        [Blob("content/settings.json")] string json)
