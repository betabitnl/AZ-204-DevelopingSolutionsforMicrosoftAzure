# Lab: Automate business processes with Logic Apps
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Your organization keeps a collection of JSON files that it uses to configure third-party products in a Server Message Block (SMB) file share in Microsoft Azure. As part of a regular auditing practice, the operations team would like to call a simple HTTP endpoint and retrieve the current list of configuration files. You have decided to implement this functionality using a no-code solution based on Azure API Management service and Logic Apps.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create a Logic App workflow.

-   Manage products and APIs in a Logic App.

-   Use Azure API Management as a proxy for a Logic App.

## Lab setup

-   Estimated time: **45 minutes**

## Instructions

### Before you start

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine
- Microsoft Edge
- Windows PowerShell
- Visual Studio Code

### Make an F:\ drive:

There are two ways to create an F:\ with the content 
1. using VHD (virtual hard disk)
2. using subst (map drive to a directory)

#### Make an F:\ drive using VHD
In order to create a VHD on Windows 10, do the following:
1. Open Start.
1. Search for Disk Management and click the top result to launch the experience.
1. Click the Action button.
1. Click the Create VHD option.
1. Click the Browse button and locate the folder you want to store the virtual disk.
1. In the "File name" field enter a name for the drive.
1. Use the "Save as type file" drop-down menu and select Virtual Disk files (.vhdx) . Or select Virtual Disk files (.vhd) if you're planning to create a VHD file.
1. Click the Save button.
1. Under "Virtual hard disk size," specify the size of the drive in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB).
1. Under "Virtual hard disk format," select the VHDX option. (While using a VHDX format is recommended, you can also select the VHD format, but use it only if required.)
1. Under "Virtual hard disk type," select the Dynamic expanding option. (If you have selected the VHD format in the previous step, it's recommended to select the Fixed size option when selecting a type.)
1. Click OK.

Once you complete these steps, you'll have created a VHD that you can then set up and use with any compatible version of Windows.

##### How to set up a VHDX or VHD on Windows 10

1. Using the above steps, you created a VHD, but it's empty without any data or file system. To make it useful, you need to initialize the disk, create a partition, and format the drive using these steps:
1. Right-click the newly created drive button on the far-left side, and click the Initialize Disk option.
1. Select the disk from the list.
1. Check the MBR (Master Boot Record) option. (You could also select the "GPT (GUID Partition Table)" option, but this option isn't supported by all versions of Windows.)
1. Click OK.
1. Right-click the Unallocated space, and select the New Simple Volume option.
1. Click Next.
1. Specify the size of the partition. (Leave this option unchanged if you're planning to use all the available space for the partition.)
1. Click Next.
1. Using the drop-down menu, select the drive letter you want to assign to the drive.
1. Click Next.
1. Under the Format this volume with the following settings section, make sure to use the following options: 
    * File System - NTFS. 
    * Allocation unit size - Default. 
    * Volume label - Use the name of the drive file, but you can enter any name. 
    * Perform a quick format - Formats the drive faster. 
    * Enable file and folder compression - If it's not required, don't select it (optional).
1. Click Next.
1. Click Finish.

After completing these steps, the VHDX or VHD will be initialized, partitioned, and formatted.
The VHD will mount automatically, and you can now access and save files using File Explorer.


##### Make sure to get the labs source and instructions from
https://github.com/betabitnl/AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure

1. Click Code
1. Click download zip
1. Open zip 
1. Extra All file to F:\

#### Make an F:\ drive using subst
By making an F:\ drive using subst it is easier to keep the labs up-to-date with the Github Repo. 

##### Clone the github repo:
In a command prompt goto the direcory where you what to clone the the Github repo into. And type the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/betabitnl/AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure`

##### Create the F:\ drive 
For this example the Github is cloned in `c:\repos\`. To create the F:\ drive with correct content in it, type:

`subst f: c:\repos\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure`

### Exercise 1: Create Azure resources

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1.  If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll notice a dialog box offering a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour.

#### Task 2: Create an API Management resource

1.  In the Azure portal, create a new API Management account with the following details:

    -   New resource group: **AutomatedWorkflow**

    -   Location: **West Europe**

    -   Organization name: **Contoso**

    -   Pricing tier: **Consumption (99.9 SLA, %)**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the API Management resource prior to moving on in the lab. You will receive a notification when the resource is created.

#### Task 3: Create a Logic App resource

1.  In the Azure portal, create a new **logic app** with the following details:
    
    -   Existing resource group: **AutomatedWorkflow**

    -   Name: **prodflow*[yourname]***

    -   Location: **Region - West Europe**

    -   Log Analytics: **Off**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the Logic Apps resource prior to moving on in the lab. You will receive a notification when the resource is created.

#### Task 4: Create a storage account

1.  Create a new storage account with the following details:
    
    -   Existing resource group: **AutomatedWorkflow**

    -   Name: **prodstor*[yourname]***

    -   Location: **(Europe) West Europe**

    -   Performance: **Standard**

    -   Status Code: **200**
    
    -   Body: **Output (Select)**

1.  **Save** the workflow.

#### Review

In this exercise, you built a basic workflow that starts when it's triggered by an HTTP GET request. It then queries a storage service, enumerates the results, and then returns those results as an HTTP response.

### Exercise 3: Use Azure API Management as a proxy for Logic Apps

#### Task 1: Create an API integrated with Logic Apps

1.  Access the **prodapim*[yourname]*** API Management resource that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Navigate to the empty list of **APIs** for the account.

### Exercise 4: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  If Cloud Shell isn't already configured, configure the shell for Bash by using the default settings.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **AutomatedWorkflow** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name AutomatedWorkflow --no-wait --yes
    ```

1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

-   Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.
